#This R code is used to manipulate and prepare necessary data and tables to plot taxonomy results in stacked bar charts and heatmaps. 

#The code sets the folder path where the taxonomy and abundance data are stored. 
#The list.files function is used to get a list of all file names with the extensions ".taxo" and ".tsv" in the specified folder.
#The code then loops over each pair of files and reads them in using read.table function.
#The first file contains the abundance data in TPM format, while the second file contains the taxonomy information for each ID. 
#The colClasses parameter is set to "character" to ensure that the taxonomy columns are read as character data. 
#The na.strings parameter is set to "NA" to ensure that any missing values are read in as "NA".
#The fill parameter is set to TRUE to ensure that the shorter rows are padded with "NA" values.
#The code then manipulates the data by renaming the abundance columns to more informative names and extracting only the relevant columns from the taxonomy data. 
#The taxonomy columns are then split using the tstrsplit function, and the resulting columns are added to the taxonomy data. 
#The merged_files are obtained by merging the abundance data and the taxonomy data by the ID column.
#Finally, the code writes the output to a file with the extension "_Abundance.tsv". 
#The output file contains the taxonomy information and abundance data in a tab-separated format that can be used to graph the taxonomy data.
